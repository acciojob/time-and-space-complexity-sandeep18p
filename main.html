	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity evaluates the efficiency of an algorithm in relation to the size of its input. Achieving efficient time complexity is crucial for ensuring swift execution, especially with large datasets. Engineers optimize algorithms to minimize time complexity, employing strategies such as algorithmic improvements and judicious data structure choices.</p>
	<p>
		Space complexity, often denoted by big O notation, measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. Algorithms with space complexity O(n) utilize a linear amount of memory proportional to the input size. Engineers aim to minimize space complexity alongside time complexity, ensuring efficient memory usage for handling large datasets or resource-constrained environments. Balancing between space and time complexity optimization is crucial for designing algorithms that perform optimally across various computational scenarios.
